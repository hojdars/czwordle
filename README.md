## Dictionary

The program is not provided with a dictionary. It expects a file called `jmena.txt` in the root directory. The file should have the following structure:

1. one word per one line
2. corpus-like tags are allowed after a forward slash `/`

Example:

```
abeceda/ZQ
pivo/MQR
kozel/PIV
```

The dictionary (or more precisely the corpus) can be in any language supported by UTF-8 (which is pretty much every language), but the letter hints only contain letters of the Czech alphabet.

The dictionary I use is not provided since I have not looked into its license yet. It can be obtained and generated by following the steps in [this blogpost (in Czech language)](http://szj.cz/seznam-ceskych-podstatnych-jmen/).

## Development
