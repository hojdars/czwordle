# ƒçwordle _[czwordle]_

A Czech port of the popular word game [wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).

![terminal czwordle showcase](https://github.com/hojdars/czwordle/blob/master/czwordle.png)

For now, it is a simple command line program. Configuration options are available in `-h`:

```
czwordle 0.1.0

USAGE:
    czwordle.exe [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -d, --dictionary <DICTIONARY>    Dictionary file to use [default: jmena.txt]
    -h, --help                       Print help information
    -l, --length <LENGTH>            Length of the words [default: 5]
    -t, --tries <TRIES>              Maximum number of tries [default: 6]
    -V, --version                    Print version information

```

## GUI

A graphical user interface is in the TODO pipeline.

## Dictionary

The program is not provided with a dictionary. It expects a file called `jmena.txt` in the root directory. The file should have the following structure:

1. one word per one line
2. corpus-like tags are allowed after a forward slash `/`

Example:

```
abeceda/ZQ
pivo/MQR
kozel/PIV
```

The dictionary (or more precisely the corpus) can be in any language supported by UTF-8 (which is pretty much every language), but the letter hints only contain letters of the Czech alphabet.

The dictionary I use is not provided since I have not looked into its license yet. It can be obtained and generated by following the steps in [this blogpost (in Czech language)](http://szj.cz/seznam-ceskych-podstatnych-jmen/).
